## About
<br>

I am a Data Professional with hands-on experience in building data pipelines, automating ETL processes, and performing Record Linkage as a Program Data Services Specialist for local government. In this role, I’ve consolidated data from various sources, developed a central database for my organization, and ensured seamless data integration for improved decision-making. My expertise in Python, R, and data visualization tools such as Tableau enables me to handle complex data challenges and transform raw data into actionable insights.

I hold a Master of Science (M.S.) in Data Science from Texas Tech University - Rawls College of Business, where I specialized in machine learning, statistics, and data analytics. This academic training, combined with my practical experience, equips me to deliver solutions that address real-world problems. I also hold a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Mathematics from The University of Texas - San Antonio, with a concentration in Mathematics, which provided me with a strong foundation in statistical modeling, linear algebra, and calculus.

In addition to my academic and professional achievements, I’ve developed a portfolio showcasing my work in data science, machine learning, and data engineering. This portfolio highlights my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical applications, ranging from predictive modeling to data visualization and database management. I am passionate about leveraging data to drive informed decisions and am continuously expanding my skills to keep up with the evolving field of data science.

### Crime Data <img src="https://github.com/LACLanthony/Images/blob/main/Screenshot 2025-03-11 090145.png" width="25"/>
**[Notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/LACLanthony/crimes_hotel/blob/main/hotels_crimes_maps.ipynb)** <br>
**Description** The goal of this project:
<ol>
     <li> Show my ability to extract data in different forms (API, Web Scrape (in "Hotel Webscrape")).</li>
     <li> Show my ability to merge information from different projects together to gain insights. </li>
     <li> Show GIS ability with Python. </li>
</ol>
<p>In the code listed above I have taken a crime database for 2023 in Austin Tx obtained form Austin gov API. This data has been merged with the hotels dataset and interesting insights were gained such as the hotels closest to crimes. This information is useful to individuals who wish to reserve a room in Austin but are unaware of the crime in the area. </p>

**Skills** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Data Analytics, Feature Engineering, Data Cleaning, Visualization, Maps/Folium


### Hotel Webscrape
**[Notebook](https://github.com/LACLanthony/hotel_webscrape/blob/main/hotel.ipynb)** <br>
**Description:** <ol>
     <li> Show my ability to webscrape to gather data (Something besides Kaggle pre-made datasets).</li>
     <li> Show my ability to clean and work the data into a useable dataset. </li>
     <li> Show GIS ability with Python. </li>
</ol>
<p>In the preceding code a list of hotels, their addresses and phone numbers were scraped from the yellow pages website. The data was then cleaned and saved into a csv file. An API was used to find the latitude and longitude of each hotel according to their addresses, the latitude and longitude were then added to the data frame. Finally Folium was used to map the hotels with markers on a map, popups of the hotel names were added to the markers.</p>

**Skills:** Web Scraping, ETL, Beautiful Soup, Requests, API, Folum maps 

### Diamond Analytics 
**[Notebook](https://github.com/LACLanthony/diamonds/blob/main/diamonds.ipynb)** <br>
**Description:** In the code above the diamonds dataset is cleaned and analyzed for any insights. The data consists of 50,000 diamonds that are categorized by the variables 'carat', 'cut', 'color', 'clarity' 'price'.  <br>
**Skills:** Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, Data Analytics, Data Cleaning

### Mushroom Machine Learning
**[Notebook](https://github.com/LACLanthony/mushroom_machine_learning/blob/main/mushrooms.ipynb)** <br>
**Description:** In the code above machine learning was used to categorize edible vs poisonous mushrooms. Naive Bayes was used first followed by logistic regression. Logistic Regression was found to be the better model. The insights gained from the logisitc regression model were used to find any new information.<br>
**Skills:** Machine Learning, Sci-kit Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes
