## About
<br>

Hello, I am Luis an aspiring Data Professional. I am currently finishing the last semester of my Master of Science (M.S.) in Data Science from Texas Tech University - Rawls College of Business. Before that I received a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) from The University of Texas - San Antonio in Mathematics with a concentration of Mathematics. As a graduate student at Texas Tech University, my studies in data science, including machine learning, statistics, mathematics, and data analytics, have prepared me for a challenging career in the field. 

During my undergraduate studies in mathematics, I developed a strong foundation in statistical modeling, linear algebra, and calculus. These skills, combined with my pursuit of a graduate degree in data science, have allowed me to excel in various projects and coursework that focus on data analysis and machine learning techniques. Throughout my academic career, I have become proficient in programming languages such as Python and R, as well as data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI.

In addition to my academic achievements, I have created a portfolio that showcases my personal work in data science and machine learning. This portfolio, I hope will demonstrate some of my abilities in applying theoretical knowledge to real-world problems.

## Portfolio Projects
<br>

### Hotel Webscrape
**[code](https://github.com/LACLanthony/hotel_webscrape/blob/main/hotel.ipynb)** <br>
**Description:** In the preceding code a list of hotels, their addresses and phone numbers were scraped from the yellow pages website. The data was then cleaned and saved into a csv file. An API was used to find the latitude and longitude of each hotel according to their addresses, the latitude and longitude were then added to the data frame. Finally Folium was used to map the hotels with markers on a map, popups of the hotel names were added to the markers.<br>
**Skills:** Web Scraping, ETL, Beautiful Soup, Requests, API, Folum maps 

### Diamond Analytics 
**[code](https://github.com/LACLanthony/diamonds/blob/main/diamonds.ipynb)** <br>
**Description:** In the code above the diamonds dataset is cleaned and analyzed for any insights. The data consists of 50,000 diamonds that are categorized by the variables 'carat', 'cut', 'color', 'clarity' 'price'.  <br>
**Skills:** Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, Data Analytics, Data Cleaning

### Mushroom Machine Learning
**[code](https://github.com/LACLanthony/mushroom_machine_learning/blob/main/mushrooms.ipynb)** <br>
**Description:** In the code above machine learning was used to categorize edible vs poisonous mushrooms. Naive Bayes was used first followed by logistic regression. Logistic Regression was found to be the better model. The insights gained from the logisitc regression model were used to find any new information.<br>
**Skills:** Machine Learning, Sci-kit Learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes

### Stock Optimization Linear Programming 
**[code](https://github.com/LACLanthony/Stocks_Linear_Programming/blob/main/stocks.ipynb)** <br>
**Description:** In the code above Simulation and Optimization methods are used to find the optimal solution oh how to distribute funds in stocks. The constraints are given and taken into consideration when finding the optimal solution. <br>
**Skills:** Python, PuLP, Linear Programming, LaTeX
